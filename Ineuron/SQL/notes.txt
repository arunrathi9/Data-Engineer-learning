);

--- Syntax 1 To insert data into a TABLE
insert into employee values(1,'Shashank',1000,'2021-09-15');

--- This statement will fail
insert into employee values(2,'Rahul','2021-09-15');

insert into employee(salary,name,id) values(2000,'Rahul',2);

--- Insert multiple rows using single insert statement
